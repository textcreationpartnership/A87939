         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Prince having a high di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165704:3"/>and indgnation again≈øt the Magi≈øtrates of Am≈øterdam contrived away whereby he intended to ≈øurprize this rich &amp; famous City by a ≈øtratagem, and to effect this de≈øign without giving cau≈øe of ≈øu≈øpicion what his intent was, He ordred Grave <hi>William</hi> of Na≈ø≈øaw to empty all frontier Garri≈øons, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of conveying the old Prince of Orange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Germany, and to be ready at the ≈øame time with his hor≈øe to enter the City, which was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be done on Saturday the thirty of July about 3 or 4 in the morning at the opening of the Gates; for effecting of which de≈øign with the more certainty and ≈øecrecie, about two hundred foot ≈øouldiers were put privately into ≈øeveral Turf boats, which were to come up to the City at the ≈øame time by water, and lying undi≈øcovered, were to fall in at the very ≈øame in≈øtant when the hor≈øe ≈øhould enter the gates, and ≈øurprize the Guard at the Regulaters high-way, which being done, he thought good to make the City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any re≈øi≈øtance. But ≈øo it was, that when the Plot was almo≈øt ready to be put in execution, it plea≈øed God to di≈øappoint al their purpo≈øes, partly by rea≈øon of the great rain which fell all Friday (July 29.) in the afternoon, and all the ≈øame night, which made the ways very deep and rotten; ≈øo that the Prince his hor≈øe having a long march, of four and twenty miles ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Then they turned to a City about ten miles off, but the Citizens refu≈øed to pa≈ø≈øe through or let them in, in regard they knew not what they were; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were forced to march another way, which was to their great di≈øadvantage, and that nigh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165704:3"/>being very dark, and wanting good guides, they mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took their way, which hindred them above three hours time, by rea≈øon whereof they could not get unto Am≈øterdam before nine of the clock on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, which was ≈øix houres after the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter the City, ≈øo that before they got thither, their de≈øign was di≈øcovered to the Magi≈øtrates, by the Po≈øt of Hambrough, who accidentally fel mong≈øt the hor≈øe, when they were doubtfull of their way, which made his company very acceptable to them, in regard they might make u≈øe of him to be their guide, but when he perceived their de≈øign, he ≈øtole away from them and ha≈øted to Am≈øterdam, and made known to the Magi≈øtrates, what he had learned by riding a while among≈øt their troops.</p>
            <p>Grave <hi>William</hi> perceiving that Providence fought again≈øt him (to the lo≈ø≈øe of the time appointed, and be≈øt opportunity) was filled with di≈øcontent, and quartered his Forces at Over-Qirtie, which is three miles from the City, attending there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further Orders from the Prince of Orange, who was at the Hague, and had there impri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many publique per≈øons that were ≈øent from Dort, Horten, Delf, and other places, and ≈øo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was he, that the de≈øign on which he had ≈øent Grave <hi>William,</hi> would take effect, that he told the impri≈øoned with his own mouth, Am≈øterdam was his own, but immediately after news was brought him to the contrary, which ≈øo much ≈øtartled him that its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aid, he took his hat, threw it one the ground, and ≈øet his feet upon it. When his heat of pa≈ø≈øion was over, he ha≈øted away and on Sunday came to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165704:4"/>Grave <hi>William,</hi> but his comming was to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, for ≈øo ≈øoon as the Magi≈øtrates of Am≈øterdam, received the information from the Po≈øt at Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough as afore≈øaid, they cau≈øed all the gates of the City to be ≈øhut up, and the booms to be lockt, which are as ≈øo many gates by water, and put all the City-Garri≈øon into arms, with their muskets ready char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with bullet, They al≈øo cau≈øed ≈øeverall Bra≈ø≈øe Guns to be mounted on their works, and ≈øent many ve≈ø≈øels well man'd and provided to lie upon Sin≈øter, which is an inland River, and ≈øome men of war rode at Anchor upon the Tij, which is an arm of the Sea, So that good guards were quickly placed about the City, both by land and water, and the apparence of men in their Arms was the more ≈øpeedier for that at the beat of Drum they were commanded forth in the name of the Magi≈øtrates of Am≈øterdam, which was a thing not u≈øuall.</p>
            <p>The city being in ≈øuch a po≈øture of defence, Grave <hi>William</hi> moved the Prince to block up the city at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance on the South ≈øide of <hi>Tij,</hi> conceiving that if they could keep provi≈øions from it, in time he ≈øhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his De≈øires. But the Magi≈øtrates wi≈øely fore≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger, cau≈øed all the Sluces to be opened, on Sunday about noon, it plea≈øed God a little before to turn the wind Northwe≈øt, which u≈øually brings in much water; by this means all the low grounds for many miles without Am≈øterdam lay under water in ≈øhort time, ≈øo that the Princes hor≈øes could have no gra≈ø≈øe, nor make nearer approaches, unle≈ø≈øe upon banks, where above three a bre≈øt could not march
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165704:4"/>and then it mu≈øt have been upon the mouth of the cannon: hereupon on ≈øunday the Prince ≈øent a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter into the city, and 4 of the Cities Councel was ≈øent to the Prince at ≈øeveral times, on Munday, Tue≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Wedne≈øday, and ≈øtayed all Tue≈øday and Wedne≈øday night with him; in all which time ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other me≈ø≈øengers came from him to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates. During all the≈øe tran≈øactions, ≈øeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters came from the mo≈øt eminent towns in Holland, and from Utritch to the Magi≈øtrates of Am≈øterdam, certifying their di≈ølike of the Princes proceedings, and ≈øeveral other Magi≈øtrates came al≈øo in per≈øon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ≈øame, which much encouraged the City, and di≈øheartned the Prince, who on Wedne≈øday was commanded by the States General (as is reported) to appear pre≈øently in the Hague, and in four and twenty hours to cau≈øe all the Forces to repair to their ≈øeveral Garri≈øons; and to that end on Thur≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning as ≈øoon as the day appeared, he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from before Am≈øterdam, at which there was no ≈ømall rejoycing. During the Prince his ab≈øence from the Hague, there hath been mutenies, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants would have plundered the Princes Court.</p>
            <p>Thus you have a Relation of the 5 days blocking up of the famous City of Am≈øterdam, who in the Hague (no doubt) will pro≈øecute the chief authors of this de≈øign, of which more hereafter.</p>
